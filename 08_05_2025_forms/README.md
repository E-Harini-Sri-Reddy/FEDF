## Learning about HTML Forms and Input Types

Today, I learned about creating a simple HTML form to explore various input types and how forms work in HTML.

### What I did:

- Built a form using the `<form>` tag.
- Used multiple input fields to collect different kinds of user data:
  - **Text input** (`type="text"`) for names.
  - **Password input** (`type="password"`) for sensitive data.
  - **Telephone input** (`type="tel"`) to accept phone numbers.
  - **Number input** (`type="number"`) for numeric values like age or quantity.
  - **Email input** (`type="email"`) that validates email format.
  - Buttons like **submit**, **reset**, and a normal **button**.
  - **Radio buttons** for selecting gender â€” only one option can be chosen.
  - **Checkboxes** for selecting multiple languages known.
  - **Date input** (`type="date"`) to pick a date.
  - **Color input** (`type="color"`) to choose a color.
  - **URL input** (`type="url"`) to enter website links.
  - **File input** (`type="file"`) to upload files.
  - **Range input** (`type="range"`) for selecting a value within a range (slider).

### What I learned:

- HTML forms are tools for gathering user input.
- Different input types make it easier to collect specific data and improve user experience.
- Some inputs provide built-in validation, like email and URL.
- Radio buttons and checkboxes serve different purposes: radio for single choice, checkboxes for multiple choices.
- Forms can be submitted using the submit button, which sends data to a specified URL or backend.
