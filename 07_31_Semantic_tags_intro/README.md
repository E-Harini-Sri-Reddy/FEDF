## Semantic Tags

Semantic tags are HTML elements that tell you (and the browser) what kind of content they contain. They make your code easier to read and give structure to your webpage.

> **Note:** Semantic tags were introduced in **HTML5**, so you won’t see them in older HTML versions.

### Common Semantic Tags:

- `<header>` – The top section of a page (like a title or logo area).
- `<nav>` – Holds your navigation links (menus, etc.).
- `<main>` – The main content of the page (the important stuff).
- `<section>` – Groups related content (like chapters or topics).
- `<article>` – Self-contained content (like blog posts or news articles).
- `<aside>` – Contains content related to the main content but separate (like sidebars, pull quotes, or ads).
- `<footer>` – The bottom part of the webpage (usually contact info, links, etc.).

### Why Semantic Tags are Important:

- **Better accessibility** – Screen readers can understand your page layout.
- **Helps with SEO** – Search engines know what’s important on your page.
- **Cleaner code** – Makes it easier for you and others to read and maintain.

In short: **Semantic tags give meaning to your HTML**. Instead of just using a bunch of `<div>`s, you’re telling the browser what each part of the page actually is.
