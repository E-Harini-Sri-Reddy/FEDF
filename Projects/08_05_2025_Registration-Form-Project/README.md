## Application: Registration Form with HTML and CSS

I applied the concepts I learned about HTML forms by creating a complete registration form with styling support.

### Features of the form:

- Used semantic and organized structure with `<section>`, `<header>`, and `<form>`.
- Included various input fields with placeholders and `required` attributes for validation:
  - Full Name (`type="text"`)
  - Email Address (`type="text"`)
  - Phone Number (`type="tel"`)
  - Birth Date (`type="date"`)
- Grouped related fields inside divs and columns for better layout.
- Created a gender selection using **radio buttons**, with one option pre-selected.
- Designed a detailed address section with multiple text inputs and a dropdown (`<select>`) for country selection.
- Used a **submit button** to send the form data.
- Linked an external CSS file (`style.css`) to style the form layout and elements.

### What I learned from this project:

- How to organize complex forms with multiple input types.
- Using grouping (`div`, columns) to control layout and user experience.
- Adding form validation with the `required` attribute.
- Implementing radio buttons properly with labels and default selection.
- Linking external CSS for styling forms cleanly.
- Structuring an HTML document for a real-world form application.

This project helped me understand how to build user-friendly, visually appealing, and functional forms using HTML and CSS.
