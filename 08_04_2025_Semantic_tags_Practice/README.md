## Classwork Activity: Semantic Tags, CSS, and Selectors

In todayâ€™s class, we practiced using **HTML semantic tags** and styling with **CSS** and **CSS Selector** based on parts of the KL University Aziz Nagar Campus website.

### What we did:

- Used tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>` to organize the page.
- Styled the page using CSS.
- Tried different CSS selectors to target and style elements.

### What I learned:

- Semantic tags help make the page easier to understand.
- CSS selectors let you style exactly what you want.
- Using semantic HTML with CSS makes webpages look good and organized.
